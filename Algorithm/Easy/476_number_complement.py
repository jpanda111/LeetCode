Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement 
strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
1. The given integer is within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
2. no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), 
and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
